<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! My name is Krutika Gundecha and I am a B.Tech student at IIT Roorkee, India. I am
   aspiring web developer and aim to be the one of the best at whatever I decide to do with my future.
   I am 20 years old and I have naumber of interests like reading fiction novels- fantasy. in particular-
   music, watching guys react and do stupid stuff on the internet (cue Drew Gooden) and watch sitcoms.
   My favorite sitcoms ever are Brooklyn 99 and Parks and Recretion.

<p>In addition to web developement, I am also interested in networking and cybersecurity as well as 
  artificial intelligence and the role it's going to play in the future on human beings. When I learnt
  how the internet works excatly..it blew my mind. Humans are capable of so, so much. But computers
  are capable of even more. Let us see how AI shapes our world!
